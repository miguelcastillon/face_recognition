# Face Recognition

This open-source tool allows to detect and recognize faces both from pictures and from the webcam video.

It performs face recognition using PCA of an existing database (which should be stored in e.g. "data/"). This database should be created by the user, storing face pictures of each person in a different folder with their name.

This project was carried out by Miguel Castillón and Carlos Gutiérrez during their internship period in TNUT Vietnam.
